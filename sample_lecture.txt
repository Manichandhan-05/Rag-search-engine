■ What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the science of making machines think and act like humans. It
enables computers to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.
What AI Can Do
– Understand language
– Recognize images and speech
– Make decisions
– Learn from experience
– Play games and solve problems
Types of AI
– Narrow AI – Designed for one task (e.g., Siri, Google Translate)
– General AI – Can perform any intellectual task a human can (still theoretical)
– Super AI – Beyond human intelligence (a future concept)
Key Concepts
– Data – Fuel for AI systems
– Algorithms – Step-by-step instructions
– Model – Learned representation of patterns
– Training – Teaching the model using data
– Inference – Making predictions using the trained model
Applications
– Chatbots and virtual assistants
– Autonomous vehicles
– Healthcare diagnostics
– Smart home devices
– Fraud detection
Challenges
– Bias and fairness
– Privacy and security
– Explainability
– Ethical concerns
 Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to
learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed for every task.
Why Machine Learning?
– Traditional programming = rules + data → output
– Machine learning = data + output → rules (model learns patterns)
Types of Machine Learning
– Supervised Learning – Trained on labeled data (input + correct output). Example:
Predicting house prices
– Unsupervised Learning – Trained on unlabeled data. Example: Grouping customers by
behavior
– Reinforcement Learning – Learns by interacting with environment. Example: Training a
robot to walk
Key Concepts
– Training Data – Data used to teach the model
– Features – Input variables (e.g., age, salary)
– Labels – Correct output (e.g., “spam” or “not spam”)
– Model – Mathematical function that maps inputs to outputs
– Loss Function – Measures how wrong the model is
– Optimization – Adjusts model to reduce errors
Common Problems
– Overfitting – Model memorizes training data, fails on new data
– Underfitting – Model is too simple, misses patterns
– Bias – Model favors certain outcomes unfairly
– Variance – Model is too sensitive to small changes
Applications
– Face and voice recognition
– Chatbots and virtual assistants
– Medical diagnosis
– Fraud detection
– Self-driving cars
– Personalized recommendations
Challenges
– Need for large, clean datasets
– High computational power
– Making models explainable
– Ensuring fairness and ethics
What is Deep Learning?
Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning that uses neural networks with many
layers. It mimics how the human brain works to learn complex patterns from large amounts
of data.
Why “Deep”?
– “Deep” refers to the number of layers in the neural network
– More layers = more learning power
Key Components
– Neurons – Basic units that process data
– Layers – Stacked neurons that transform input
– Weights – Values that adjust learning
– Activation Function – Decides what gets passed to the next layer
– Loss Function – Measures error
– Backpropagation – Updates weights to reduce error
Popular Architectures
– CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) – For images
– RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) – For sequences
– Transformer – For language tasks (like ChatGPT!)
Applications
– Image and speech recognition
– Language translation
– Self-driving cars
– Medical imaging
– Game playing (e.g., AlphaGo)
– Image segmentation
Challenges
– Requires lots of data
– Needs powerful hardware
– Hard to interpret
– Can be biased
